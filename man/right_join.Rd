\usage{
right_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c(".x", ".y"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{tbls to join. (See dplyr)}

\item{y}{tbls to join. (See dplyr)}

\item{by}{A character vector of variables to join by. (See dplyr)}

\item{copy}{If x and y are not from the same data source, and copy is TRUE,
then y will be copied into the same src as x. (See dplyr)}

\item{suffix}{If there are non-joined duplicate variables in x and y, these
suffixes will be added to the output to disambiguate them. Should be a
